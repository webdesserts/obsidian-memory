//! Vault-scoped gossip codec over p2p-core's generic byte-transport.
//!
//! Each vault subscribes to its own gossip topic (derived from its VaultId). The
//! transport itself — membership (`NeighborUp`/`NeighborDown`) and opaque
//! broadcast/receive — lives in `p2p_core::GossipSubscription`. This module is the
//! thin VAULT codec on top:
//!
//! - Outbound: serialize a [`GossipMessage`] with bincode and hand the bytes to
//!   the transport (`GossipHandle::broadcast`).
//! - Inbound: a decode pump consumes the transport's generic events, deserializes
//!   `Data` payloads back into [`GossipMessage`], and surfaces decoded vault-level
//!   [`GossipEvent`]s to the daemon.
//!
//! All gossip payloads are wrapped in [`GossipMessage`] so the wire format can
//! carry multiple message types without breaking framing. The bincode encoding of
//! that envelope is the gossip WIRE format — a mixed-version fleet depends on it
//! byte-for-byte, so it is pinned by `golden_change_notification_bytes_are_stable`.
//!
//! Gossip messages must be small (~1KB). Large sync data goes through QUIC streams.
