//! mDNS mesh discovery actor backed by `mdns-sd`.
//!
//! `MeshMdns` wraps a `mdns_sd::ServiceDaemon` configured for IPv4-only operation
//! on macOS-hostile networks. The previous `swarm-discovery` backend had three
//! independent macOS problems:
//!
//! - Per-interface specific-IP binds collide with mDNSResponder on `:5353` (EADDRINUSE).
//! - `INADDR_ANY` join roulettes between IPv4 interfaces on multi-interface hosts.
//! - IPv6 join storms `EHOSTUNREACH` on hosts with utun-injected IPv6 default routes.
//!
//! `mdns-sd` does the macOS-correct thing: wildcard bind with `SO_REUSEPORT`,
//! per-interface `IP_MULTICAST_IF` for send, per-interface `IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP`
//! for receive, `disable_interface(IfKind::IPv6)` to kill the utun-driven v6
//! storm cleanly, and `disable_interface(IfKind::LoopbackV4)` so that
//! `enable_addr_auto` only considers real interfaces (en0/en1) and announces
//! on the LAN.
//!
//! ## Custom port (5454, not 5353)
//!
//! We bind on `MESH_MDNS_PORT` (5454) instead of the standard mDNS port (5353).
//! Even with `SO_REUSEPORT`, when macOS `mDNSResponder` is already bound to
//! `:5353`, the kernel load-balances incoming multicast across the REUSEPORT
//! group — our socket can be starved of receives while `mDNSResponder` collects
//! the wire traffic. Using 5454 makes our daemon the sole listener on its port,
//! so every announce from a peer reaches us. We never used system Bonjour
//! interop (peers talk daemon-to-daemon), so the only loss is `dns-sd` CLI
//! visibility. Both publisher and browser share one `ServiceDaemon`, so the
//! port choice applies symmetrically.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! A long-lived tokio task (the "actor") owns all mutable state. All public
//! methods send messages to it via an mpsc channel. The actor:
//!
//! - Maintains canonical state: `last_user_data`, `last_relay_url`, `last_port`,
//!   `last_addrs`.
//! - On every config change (any of the four fields), rebuilds a **complete**
//!   `ServiceInfo` from all current state and calls `daemon.register()`. Per the
//!   mdns-sd docs, calling `register()` again re-announces with updated info;
//!   no `unregister` is needed. This makes the user-data clobber bug structurally
//!   impossible: every register carries every field.
//! - Bridges `mdns_sd::ServiceDaemon::browse()` — which returns a flume `Receiver`
//!   driven by the daemon's internal OS thread — into the tokio actor via a spawned
//!   bridge task using `recv_async().await`.
//!
//! ## AddressLookup integration
//!
//! `MeshMdns` implements iroh's `AddressLookup` trait so that
//! `endpoint.connect(node_id, ALPN)` works without ever calling `add_node_addr`.
//! `publish()` extracts the relay URL and IPv4 socket addresses from iroh's
//! `EndpointData` and routes them through the actor channel. `user_data` is
//! intentionally NOT extracted in `publish()` — it is managed separately via
//! `set_user_data` to prevent iroh's auto-publish from clobbering our JSON.

//   traffic than the old flat 1.5s cadence.
//
