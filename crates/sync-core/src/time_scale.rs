//! Process-global test-time-scale lever.
//!
//! A single process-wide multiplier on the time-based durations the sync stack
//! owns, so the time-dependent sync test suite runs faster and less flakily
//! (e.g. `OBSIDIAN_MEMORY_TIME_SCALE=0.1` turns a 30s sync-flag TTL into 3s).
//! It is the *general* lever for durations that lack a per-component test setter;
//! components with explicit setters (the supervisor/reconcile interval setters)
//! keep using those for precise control, and this fills the gap for everything
//! else.
//!
//! ## Production safety — the property that gates everything
//!
//! With no scale ever seeded (production: desktop app, daemon, and the WASM
//! plugin), [`time_scale`] returns exactly `1.0` and [`scaled`] / [`scaled_ms`]
//! take an early-return identity branch — the returned value is the base
//! UNCHANGED, with no float arithmetic applied. Production timing is therefore
//! bit-identical to a build without this module. [`MAX_SCALE`] is `1.0`, making
//! this a speed-up-only lever: even a *set* scale can only shrink a duration,
//! never lengthen it, so a misconfigured env var can at worst speed tests up.
//!
//! ## WASM safety
//!
//! This module is wasm-safe by construction: it uses only [`OnceLock`] and
//! [`std::time::Duration`] and reads NO environment variable (the
//! `OBSIDIAN_MEMORY_TIME_SCALE` read lives in sync-daemon's `startup_inner`,
//! never here). The WASM/plugin build has no startup seeding hook, so it always
//! observes the `1.0` default.
