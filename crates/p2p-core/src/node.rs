//! P2pNode: top-level iroh networking component.

//! Creates an iroh Endpoint from an ed25519 identity key, registers the gossip
//! and pairing ALPNs (and a caller-supplied sync ALPN + handler), and provides
//! methods for generic gossip topics and LAN mesh discovery.
//!
//! This is the application-agnostic networking node. The vault-sync protocol
//! (`SYNC_ALPN`, the default `SyncStreamHandler`, and the `VaultId`-typed topic
//! wrappers) lives in `sync-core`, which supplies the sync handler through the
//! seam constructors and wraps the generic topic helpers via `VaultGossipExt`.
