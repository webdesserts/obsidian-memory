//! Generic gossip byte-transport over iroh-gossip.
//!
//! A [`GossipSubscription`] is the app-agnostic transport for one gossip topic:
//! it broadcasts opaque payloads and yields a stream of generic membership/data
//! events ([`GossipEvent`]). p2p-core does NOT interpret the payload bytes — the
//! app owns its codec. sync-core layers its `GossipMessage` bincode codec on top
//! via a thin wrapper (`VaultGossip`).
//!
//! ## The pump
//!
//! [`P2pNode::subscribe`](crate::P2pNode::subscribe) splits the iroh-gossip topic
//! into a sender + receiver, then spawns a task (the "pump") that translates
//! iroh-gossip's `Event`s into [`GossipEvent`]s on an mpsc channel. The pump runs
//! for the life of the subscription and is held by an [`AbortOnDropHandle`] so
//! dropping the subscription aborts the pump (which drops the receiver half) and,
//! together with the sender dropping, leaves the gossip topic. See
//! [`GossipSubscription`] for the lifecycle contract.
