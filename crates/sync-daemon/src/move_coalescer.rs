//! Native-move coalescing buffer (P4f-1 — files only).
//!
//! macOS FSEvents (and the watcher built on it) give no rename linkage: a native
//! file move/rename surfaces as a `Deleted(old)` plus a `Modified(new)`, unlinked
//! and in EITHER order (see `watcher.rs`). Dispatched naively that is a tombstone
//! plus a fresh-UUID create — the document's lineage (its UUID + CRDT history) is
//! lost, and a peer re-downloads the full content under a new identity.
//!
//! This buffer re-stitches the pair. It holds not-yet-tracked creates and deletes
//! for a short window (`MOVE_WINDOW`), keyed by the document's portable
//! [`content_hash`](vault_sync::content_hash). When the second half of a pair
//! arrives within the window — in either order — the two collapse into ONE
//! same-UUID move (`Index::move_node`), which re-parents the existing node and
//! re-transfers zero content (INV-1). On window expiry with no partner, a buffered
//! event commits to its standalone meaning: a lone delete is a real tombstone, a
//! lone create is a real new document (never a silent drop).
//!
//! ## Determinism boundary (why this is safe)
//!
//! Move DETECTION is a local, wall-clock heuristic over ONE machine's event
//! stream — it never enters the convergence/merge math. Whatever crosses the wire
//! is either a `tree.mov` or a (tombstone + new node), both of which the
//! deterministic merge layer resolves to one converged state with content always
//! preserved. Two replicas can detect the same user action via different local
//! heuristics (one coalesces, the other window-misses and sees create+delete) and
//! still converge. So all timing/ordering logic lives here, in the daemon, and no
//! wall-clock value ever reaches a synced op's payload.
//!
//! ## Scope (P4f-1)
//!
//! Files only, in-memory only. No persistence/crash-recovery (P4f-2) and no
//! folder-move recognizer (P4f-3). The buffer is intentionally pure: it owns no
//! vault handle and performs no I/O. The caller (the daemon) computes content
//! hashes against the vault, feeds events in, and executes the [`MoveDecision`]s
//! and [`Expired`] records the buffer returns. That keeps the timing state machine
//! unit-testable in isolation.
