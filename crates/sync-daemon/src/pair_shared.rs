/// - **`peer_lookup`** (live/ephemeral) — seeded so the current session reaches
///   the responder by `EndpointId` before gossip warms up (pairing-then-immediate
///   -sync needs it). This is an in-memory write only; per-peer relay hints are
///   no longer persisted (the public-relay set is the sole durable store).
///
/// `responder_id` is the transport-verified identity of the QUIC connection the
/// initiator dialed — not inferred from `PairingResult.mesh_members` — so the
/// binding is correct even if `mesh_members` ordering or content differs.
///
/// `relay_urls` is currently always single-source (the responder's own relay),
/// so taking the first non-empty entry is sound. Mesh-wide relay propagation
/// (other members' relays) is deferred.

/// today — the `PairingHello` message does not carry a relay URL. That
/// propagation is deferred to a future phase.

/// device keypair as a side effect; that is acceptable — a device pairing in
/// needs an identity anyway.
