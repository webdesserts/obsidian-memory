//! Startup seam: lock acquisition, vault init, node startup, and public entry points.
//!
//! This module owns `startup_inner`, `StartupBundle`, and the three public entry points

/// - The **outer `Result`** covers everything up to and including `Daemon::new()` —
///   lock acquire, vault load, identity load, relay start, SyncNode creation, mDNS
///   publish, gossip join, health endpoint, file watcher. Startup failures bubble up
///   as `Err` before any `DaemonControl` is materialized.
/// - **`DaemonControl`** is yielded after `Daemon::new()` returns successfully, giving
///   the caller a way to observe status and drive pairing.
/// - The **inner `JoinHandle<Result<()>>`** owns the event loop and graceful shutdown.
///   Its `Result` covers only runtime errors (not startup failures).

/// If `shutdown` fires during startup, the function returns `Ok(...)` with the join
/// handle already resolved — callers can safely await it.
