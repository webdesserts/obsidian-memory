//! Daemon-side pumped sync transport.
//!
//! vault-sync's handshake is variable-length: a converged pair settles in one
//! round-trip (`SyncRequest → InSync`), a diverged pair runs the full
//! `SyncRequest → DigestMismatch → SyncExchange → SyncResponse`. Either way the
//! exchange terminates when a side's `process_message` yields `reply: None`. The
//! daemon must therefore PUMP a single QUIC bi-stream — feeding each reply back
//! and reading the next — rather than the one-request / one-reply / half-close
//! that sync-core's shared `connect_and_sync_raw` / `SyncStreamHandler` do.
//!
//! This module is the daemon's own pumped path for BOTH directions:
//! - [`pump_outbound`] drives the exchange as the initiator (used by
//!   `spawn_sync_exchange`).
//! - [`PumpedSyncHandler`] is the inbound `ProtocolHandler`, registered on
//!   `SYNC_ALPN` via [`sync_core::network::SyncNode::new_with_sync_handler`].
//!
//! **sync-core's `streams.rs` is deliberately left untouched** — sync-wasm rides
//! the unchanged one-shot path. The framing here ([`write_frame`]/[`read_frame`])
//! re-derives sync-core's `[u32 LE len][bytes]` format on purpose: duplicating
//! ~20 trivial lines is the price of not modifying a shared transport seam two
//! consumers depend on. The cap below MUST stay in lockstep with sync-core's
//! `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`.
//!
//! # Lock discipline (the load-bearing correctness rule)
//!
//! Both pump directions NEVER hold `vault.lock()` across a network `.await`. The
//! lock is scoped to each `process_message` call only — acquire, process, drop,
//! THEN read/write the wire. Holding it across a network await would deadlock
//! against a concurrent reverse-initiated sync (the "both sides initiate" design)
//! that also wants the vault.
