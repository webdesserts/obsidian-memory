//! In-process daemon control handle for the desktop app.
//!
//! When the desktop app embeds the sync daemon via `run_with_shutdown_controlled`,
//! it receives a `DaemonControl` back immediately after startup succeeds. This
//! handle lets the tray observe daemon status changes and drive pairing without
//! polling.
//!
//! The CLI entry points (`run` / `run_with_shutdown`) are unchanged — they drop
//! the `DaemonControl` internally and are unaffected by this module.
