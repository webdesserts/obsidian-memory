/// Integration test: boot reconcile is resilient to a per-file failure on a real fs.
///
/// Background (the sync-core lineage of this guard): `NativeFs` once mapped every IO
/// error to `FsError::Io`, but the skip-deleted-file guard only matches
/// `FsError::NotFound`. On native vaults a `NotFound` that surfaced as `Io` aborted the
/// whole pass — taking unrelated files down with the one that failed. `InMemoryFs`
/// returned proper `NotFound`, so the bug was invisible in tests (test/prod divergence),
/// which is why the fs conformance suite now pins the NotFound contract for both
/// implementations (`native_fs_passes_conformance_suite`).
///
/// In vault-sync the per-file-error-must-not-abort-the-pass guard lives in boot reconcile
/// (`Vault::reconcile`, run during `Vault::load`): a file that fails mid-pass (e.g.
/// race-deleted, or a tombstoned strand that fails to quarantine) is logged and skipped,
/// and the rest of the pass still runs. (The inbound `process_message` path has no
/// per-file reconcile loop — its `ensure_consistency` hook is a no-op — so this guard is
/// reachable only through boot reconcile.) This test exercises that on a real NativeFs
/// vault: a mixed pass with one file that needs special handling (a tombstoned disk
/// strand to quarantine) plus an unrelated valid file must process BOTH — the strand's
/// handling never aborts the valid file's reconcile.
