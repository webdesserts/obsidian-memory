//! Acceptance tests for the Index in isolation — the UUID-keyed catalog.

//! These drive the Index's public API the way the future `Vault<F>` handle (and

//! delete it, and round-trip the catalog through a save+load. The headline
//! property under test is UUID identity — a node's UUID is stable across a move,
//! and a move touches no content (its `docs/<uuid>.loro` path never changes).
