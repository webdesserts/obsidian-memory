//! Apply inbound document updates: merge an existing document or materialize a new
//! one, keyed by UUID.
//!
//! Carried from `sync-core`'s `sync_engine/document_apply.rs`, with the headline
//! simplification the UUID model buys: the entire "silent latest-wins divergence"
//! branch is GONE. The old code keyed updates by path, so two replicas that
//! independently created different documents at the same path would collide; it
//! resolved that by comparing machine-local mtimes and silently overwriting the
//! loser (INV-3 violation, non-deterministic). Under UUID keying a same-UUID merge
//! is ALWAYS a normal CRDT merge (INV-2); a distinct-UUID same-path collision is the
//! P2 conflict cascade's job (handled in `apply_index.rs` over the merged state),
//! never here. No mtime, no divergence branch, no latest-wins.
//!
//! ## The Flow-2 gate is structural (INV-8)
//!
//! A `DocUpdate{uuid}` can only materialize once its Index node has arrived: with no
//! node, the UUID resolves to no path, so there is nowhere to write the `.md` and no
//! `docs/<uuid>.loro` to address. The resolution returning `None` IS the gate — the
//! update is warned-and-held, recovered when the node lands (the send side ships the
//! node with the doc, C3) or at boot reconcile (C4).
