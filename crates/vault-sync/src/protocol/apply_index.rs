//! Carried from `sync-core`'s `sync_engine/registry_apply.rs`. Two structural
//! departures the UUID model forces:
//!
//! - **The twin-dedupe machinery is gone.** It guarded a path-hash collision class
//!   (two alive nodes colliding on one `simple_hash(path)` doc_id) that UUID
//!   identity dissolves — distinct documents now have distinct UUIDs, so they never
//!   shadow each other in the caches. The inline duplicate-twin data-loss tests went
//!   with it.
//! - **`.loro` cleanup splits by reason, and a move re-materializes the `.md`.** A
//!   content `.loro` is addressed by UUID (`docs/<uuid>.loro`), path-independently.
//!   So a DELETED path's `.loro` is removed (the document is gone), but a MOVED-away
//!   path keeps its `.loro` (the same document lives on at the new path under the
//!   same UUID). Crucially, because a move re-transfers ZERO content (INV-1), the
//!   moved document's `.md` never arrives over the wire — so the receiver must
//!   re-materialize the `.md` at the NEW path from its existing local `<uuid>.loro`.
//!   (The old path-keyed sync sidestepped this by re-sending the whole document under
//!   the new path; the UUID model makes the move zero-content and re-materializes
//!   locally instead.)

    /// occupying folder rather than onto it), so this hand-crafts the plan and calls the
    /// apply path directly. It guards a future resolver bug: `node_for_path` sees only
    /// FILE nodes, so without also checking `find_folder_node`, the move-target-free test
    /// would treat a folder-occupied path as free and silently move a file onto it —
    /// leaving a file AND a folder at one display path (a tree inconsistency). The fix
    /// classifies a folder occupant as occupied → the move can't be placed → S1 error.
    ///
    /// The target is a `.md`-suffixed folder path (`Notes.md` as a folder — the real
    /// file-vs-folder shape), because every conflict rename/relocate targets a `.md`
    /// path: that is what makes the un-fixed path a SILENT `Ok` corruption (the inner
    /// `validate_sync_path` passes) rather than an incidental `InvalidPath` rejection.
