//! Boot reconciliation: bring the Index back in sync with the filesystem before
//! the vault opens to remote sync (INV-7, FR-7).
//!
//! Carried from `sync-core`'s `vault/reconcile.rs`, re-keyed on UUID. Despite living
//! under `index/`, this is an `impl<F: FileSystem> Vault<F>` block: reconcile needs
//! the filesystem, the document cache, and the Index together — all of which the
//! public [`Vault`] handle owns. The Index alone is fs-agnostic.
//!
//! ## What reconcile owns (the fs↔loro divergence heal)
//!
//! The sync engine is purely event-driven, so any gap between disk and the Index is
//! permanent without a reconciliation pass. On every load `reconcile`:
//!
//! - **Adopts** an orphaned content doc (`docs/<uuid>.loro` with no live node) by
//!   registering a node for it, healing the divergence class where a peer's content
//!   landed on disk without its Index node. Under UUID keying the content doc is
//!   location-agnostic (OQ-3 deleted its stored `_meta.path`), so the orphan is
//!   paired to its on-disk `.md` by content hash, and the adopted node's path is the
//!   `.md`'s path.
//! - **Re-attaches a native move's lineage** (EC-8/S1): a `delete(old)` + `create(new)`
//!   on disk leaves the old node tombstoned (carrying `path == old`, `uuid == U`) and
//!   `docs/U.loro` orphaned. The new `.md`, when its content matches the orphan and
//!   the orphan's tombstoned path differs from the new path, re-attaches U at the new
//!   path — a zero-content move (the content `.loro` is never rewritten).
//! - **Quarantines** a tombstoned disk orphan (a `.md` still on disk at a tombstoned
//!   path) to `.trash/` — NEVER resurrecting a user's deletion.
//! - **Reports** an alive node whose backing `.md` is gone (REPORT-ONLY: it neither
//!   recreates the file nor tombstones the node — both are data-loss classes).
//! - **Rebuilds** the LOCAL `content_version` table: the fingerprint is a per-replica
//!   transient cache (no peer can write it), rebuilt from each content doc's actual
//!   `state_vv()` on every boot so the compare digest (P3) reads a correct local value.
//!
//! ## Boot order (INV-7 — load-bearing)
//!
//! `Vault::load` loads the Index (hard-failing on corruption — EC-9), rebuilds the
//! caches, runs `reconcile` (documenting local fs into the Index), and ONLY THEN
//! opens to remote (`process_message`). Local state is fully captured before any
//! remote delta integrates — "commit before pull."

    //! How the collision is reached in the field: a peer's whole-folder delete sweeps a
    //! concurrently-added child (EC-7). TWO replicas can each rescue that same swept orphan

    //! revived parent chain (it never reuses the tombstoned one). Once those two replicas'
    //! Indexes merge, two DISTINCT live folder nodes sit at one path. The apply path always
    //! fires `resolve_structural_conflicts` right after its rescue, collapsing this within
    //! the same `process_message`; boot reconcile must mirror that. This test stages exactly
    //! that merged collision in a vault's persisted Index and asserts a `Vault::load` (which
    //! runs reconcile) collapses it to ONE folder node.
    //!
    //! Built from the `pub(crate)` Index seam (`import_updates`/`index_tree`) because the

    //! collapses it. It is therefore an in-crate test of the reconcile boot invariant, with
